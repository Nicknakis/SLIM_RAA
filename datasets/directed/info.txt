Directed Graphs Input Format


*edges.txt contains the training data with three columns i,j,w where i is the row position and j the column position of the edge and w is the weight of the edge.


*removed_edges.txt has the same format as the edges.txt file but contains the position and weights of the missing edges to be predicted



*sparse_i_zer.txt and sparse_j_zer.txt contains  the test set positions of zero inputs these are used in the testing phase for the positive vs zero and negative vs zero experiments in link prediction


*sparse_i_zer_train.txt and sparse_j_zer_train.txt contain the set of zero inputs on the residual graphs that are used to train Logistic regression.
